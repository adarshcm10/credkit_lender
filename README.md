# CREDKiT Lender

Credkit is a revolutionary financial app for Android and iOS that cuts out the middleman. By leveraging blockchain technology, Credkit creates a secure peer-to-peer lending marketplace. Borrowers can directly connect with lenders, bypassing traditional banks and their fees.  Smart contracts, automated agreements on the blockchain, ensure secure transactions and repayment.  Users have the freedom to negotiate loan terms, including interest rates and durations, creating a more flexible and potentially more affordable borrowing experience.
